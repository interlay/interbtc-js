# interbtc-js

## About

**WARNING: The goal of this package is to bring together all the JavaScript-related packages developed for interBTC, and wrap around calls that need extra processing for strong typing. Because this is still a work in progress, `@interlay/interbtc-index-client` still needs to be imported explicitly.**

This library connects the following packages for ease-of-use:

- [interbtc-api](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-api)
- [interbtc-index](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-index)
