## About

The interbtc TypeScript library connects the Polkadot ecosystem with Bitcoin. It allows the creation of interBTC, a fungible token that represents Bitcoin in the Polkadot ecosystem. InterBTC is backed by Bitcoin 1:1 and allows redeeming of the equivalent amount of Bitcoins by relying on a collateralized third-party (Vaults).
In comparison to other bridge constructions (like tBTC, wBTC, or RenVM) _anyone_ can become an intermediary by depositing collateral making interBTC the only truly open system.
